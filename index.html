        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p> I am Fiyinfoluwa Ajepe, born on March 24, 2001, in Lagos state, Nigeria. 
            As a recent graduate of Ekiti State University, where I studied Computer Engineering,
            my journey in the field of technology has been an exciting one. <br> <br>
            I spent my formative years in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. Growing up, I had a keen interest in
            computers and technology, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. During my time at Ekiti
            State University, I gained a strong foundation in various aspects of computer engineering, including programming,
            hardware, and software development. <br> <br>
            In year 2023, I proudly graduated from Ekiti State University. Now, I am excited to embark on my professional career in the field of computer
            engineering. I am eager to apply the skills and knowledge I've acquired during my studies to real-world projects and
            challenges. <br> <br>
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep interest in playing games,reading novels.
            These passions have enriched my life and provided a well-rounded perspective on the world. <br> <br>
            As I look forward to the future, I am determined to make a meaningful impact in the field of
            computer engineering. My journey has just begun, and I am excited to see where my dedication 
            and love for technology will take me.</p>
